# Byte-le 2026 Client Package

Welcome to Byte-le 2026! This is the client package that will be used to compete. You can follow the instructions listed in the Byte-le 2026 documentation in the [Getting Started](https://caitlinazazel.github.io/Byte-le-Engine-v2-2026/getting_started.html) section.

You will be connected to the server already, so all provided commands will work.

If there are any questions, don't be afraid to message a developer in the Discord or call us over!
